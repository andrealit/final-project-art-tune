# Art Tune :art:

An app that generates classic art images from the Chicago Art Institute database from a song search up!

## CS492 Final Project

We created this app as a creative way to combine two APIs and allow the user some fun in finding combinations of songs and art.

## How to Install and Use

1. `clone` repository in Android Studio.
2. Ensure you have a functioning Device Manager.
3. Run `app`.
4. Get artistic.
